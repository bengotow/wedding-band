### Wedding Band
This repo contains the source files I used to create my wedding band. I wanted a hammered look similar to  [this design by Rebecca Obermann](http://www.rebeccaovermann.com/shop/mens-soft-facets-band/), but found that Shapeways uses pretty much the same process and would be $1,000 cheaper.
